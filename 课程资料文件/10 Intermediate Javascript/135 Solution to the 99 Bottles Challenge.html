There are many others, as long as you achieve the desired outcome -printing the lyrics to the 99 bottles of beer song- then you are successful! If you've come up with a fancy solution or something different, be sure to share it in the Q&amp;A section for other students to learn from!</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">var numberOfBottles = 99<br>while (numberOfBottles &gt;= 0) {<br>    var bottleWord = "bottle";<br>    if (numberOfBottles === 1) {<br>        bottleWord = "bottles";<br>    } <br>    console.log(numberOfBottles + " " + bottleWord + " of beer on the wall");<br>    console.log(numberOfBottles + " " + bottleWord + " of beer,");<br>    console.log("Take one down, pass it around,");<br>	numberOfBottles--;<br>    console.log(numberOfBottles + " " + bottleWord + " of beer on the wall.");<br>}</pre><p>If you want to challenge yourself further, try changing the code to make the english more grammatically correct. So the final output should say "1 <strong>bottle</strong> of beer on the wall" when <code>numberOfBottles</code> is equal to <code>1</code> rather than "1 <strong>bottles</strong> of beer on the wall" and when <code>numberOfBottles</code> is equal to <code>0</code>, you can make the output "<strong>No more</strong> bottles of beer on the wall" instead of <strong>0</strong> bottles of beer on the wall".</p></p></div></div></div></body></html>
